This project aims to design personalized, data-driven policy recommendations for education programs, for example, math course-taking plans in high school. We leverage recent advances in personalized medicine, known as optimal (dynamic) treatment regimes, to recommend the best treatment option for each individual in a way that maximizes a desirable educational outcome. In addition to optimizing utility, we incorporate critical considerations such as feasibility, interpretability, and fairness into the recommendation models. 

This work is supported by NSF’s EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program.
